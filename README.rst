Elasticsearch Gatherer Plugin
=============================

The gatherer plugin for Elasticsearch is a framework for scalable data fetching and indexing.
Content adapters are implemented in gatherer zip archives which are a special kind of plugins
distributable over Elasticsearch nodes. They can receive job requests and execute them in local
queues. Job states are maintained in a special index.

This plugin is under development.

Milestone 1 - deploy gatherer zips to nodes

Milestone 2 - job specification and execution

Milestone 3 - porting JDBC river to JDBC gatherer

Milestone 4 - gatherer job distribution by load/queue length/node name, cron jobs

Milestone 5 - more gatherers, more content adapters

Milestone 1 is reached: basic deployment of gatherer zips works::

    curl -XPOST '0:9200/_deploy?name=test&path=/tmp/elasticsearch-gatherer-0.90.9.1.zip'
    {"deploy":true}

    curl '0:9200/_nodes?pretty'
    {
      "ok" : true,
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "nodes" : {
        "5gMqZ00JQ72RhnUdBnDc6g" : {
          "name" : "Thinker",
          "transport_address" : "inet[/192.168.1.113:9300]",
          "hostname" : "Jorg-Prantes-MacBook-Pro.local",
          "version" : "0.90.9",
          "gatherer.length" : "0",
          "http_address" : "inet[/192.168.1.113:9200]",
          "gatherer.modules" : "test/dummy-gatherer",
          "gatherer.load" : "2.4326171875"
        }
      }
    }
